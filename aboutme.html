        A Student at Cavite State University-Main Campus<br><br>
        A curious mind with a passion for building and designing, I specialize in crafting responsive websites that blend clean code 
        with creative flair. With a foundation in HTML, CSS, and a growing command of JavaScript, I enjoy turning ideas into interactive 
        experiences that feel intuitive and engaging.<br><br>
        My journey into web development began with a fascination for how things work behind the screen. What started as simple layouts 
        soon evolved into dynamic projects that challenge both logic and imagination. I believe that great design isn’t just about 
        aesthetics — it’s about clarity, usability, and purpose.<br><br>
        Beyond the code, I find inspiration in visual storytelling, digital illustration, and the occasional stroll with a camera in hand.
        Whether it’s refining a portfolio, experimenting with new design trends, or diving into game mechanics, I’m always exploring ways 
        to grow and create.<br><br>
        Currently studying Information Technology, I’m focused on expanding my skills, building meaningful projects, and collaborating 
        with others who share the same drive for innovation. Every line of code is a step forward — and I’m just getting started.
