 <h4>How I Started My Web Dev Journey</h4>   
<p>I began exploring web development during my first year at Cavite State University. At first, HTML and CSS felt like a foreign language, but I was determined to learn. I spent hours experimenting with layouts, colors, and structure. Over time, I realized that coding is more than just syntax — it's a creative tool that lets me build ideas from scratch.
</p>
<h4> Designing My Portfolio </h4> 
<p>Creating my portfolio was both exciting and challenging. I wanted it to reflect who I am — a developer with a passion for clean design and functionality. I focused on responsive layouts, intuitive navigation, and a touch of personality. Every section, from “About Me” to “Projects,” was crafted to tell my story and showcase my growth.
</p>
<h4>Lessons from My First JavaScript Project  </h4>
<p>My first JavaScript project was a simple to-do list app. It taught me how to interact with the DOM, handle user input, and debug errors. I learned that even small projects can teach big lessons. The experience gave me confidence and sparked my interest in building more interactive features.
</p>
<h4>Why I Love Web Design</h4>  
<p>Web design lets me blend logic with creativity. I enjoy choosing color palettes, experimenting with typography, and creating layouts that feel intuitive. It’s like solving a puzzle where every piece — code, design, user experience — fits together to form something meaningful.
